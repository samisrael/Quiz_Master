# Quiz_Master
## Date: 12/07/2025
## Objective:
To demonstrate the concepts of callback functions and higher-order functions in JavaScript by building a simple quiz scoring system where the evaluation logic is passed as a callback to a higher-order function.

## Tasks:

#### 1. Create the HTML Layout:
Add a heading ```<h1>QuizMaster</h1>```

Add a few mock questions (or inputs for answers — optional)

Add a “Check Score” button

Display the final score in a ```<div> or <p>```

#### 2. Add CSS Styling:
Style the layout with a clean font and spacing

Add background color and rounded buttons

Keep the output score in a prominent style

#### 3. JavaScript Functionality:
Create a higher-order function called calculateScore(callback)

The callback will contain the logic for checking answers (or mocked results)

Pass different callback functions to demonstrate modular scoring (e.g., strict or lenient scoring)
## HTML Code:
## CSS Code:
## JavaScript Code:
## Output:

## Result:
A mini module using JavaScript callbacks and higher-order functions is successfully created. This reinforces real-world use of passing functions as arguments to other functions and modularizes logic for reusability.
